# spam_classifier
In this project, I have used Python and scikit-learn to build a Logistic Regression Classifier, and applied it to predict whether an email is Spam or Ham.

The world is full of textual data being generated at a very rapid pace each second. The most important data preprocessing steps include accessing and cleansing the real-time data,
transforming it to get a refined form,and making it in an ML-algorithm compatible way by representing the textual data into numerical form.

I have achieved all these data preprocessing steps using NLTK - a famous Natural Language Processing API - in conjunction with Python. 

I have built data transformers and used them in scikit-learn pipelines in order to effectively preprocess the data.

Finally, I have built a Logistic Regression Classifier to predict the class of an email.
